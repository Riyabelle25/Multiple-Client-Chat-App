# Multiple-Client-Chat-App

# First open the terminal and compile the cpp file:
run these commands to compile-

 g++ -o server.o chatRoom.cpp
 ./server.o
 
 Ta-da the server is up and running!!
 
# Now, open other terminal windows and run-
 
  telnet localhost 8888
  
  You now got a ChatRoom situation. Have the clients post comments, and see the messages reflect on everyone's chat window :D
