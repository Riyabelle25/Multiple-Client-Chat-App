# Multiple-Client-Chat-App

I have first implemented one-to-one Chat Application in the branch Chat.

To check it out,

# First run server.cpp on terminal with commands -

 g++ -o server.o server.cpp
 
 ./server.o
 
 # Then run client.cpp on another terminal window like this -
 
  g++ -o client.o client.cpp
 
 ./client.o
